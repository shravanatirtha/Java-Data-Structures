/*
In an online game, N blocks are arranged in a hierarchical manner. All the blocks are connected together by a total of N-1 connections. Each block is given an ID from 1 to N. A block may be further connected to other blocks. Each block is also assigned a specific point value.

A player starts from Block 1. She must move forward from each block to a directly connected block until she reaches the final block, which has no further connection. When the player lands on a block, she collects the point value of that block. The players score is calculated as the product of point values that the player collects.
Find the maximum score a player can achieve.
Note: The answer can always be represented with 64 bits.
